            <h3>Ingredient list (Serving: 2 people)</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>2 ripe plantains</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>Sea salt</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Peel plantains by cutting off both ends, and cutting a slit down the side of each plantain</li>
                <li>Remove the plantain peel by peeling it side to side rather than lengthwise.</li>
                <li>Cut the peeled plantains into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Diagonally is preferred because it provides a larger surface for caramelization; it can be cut straight across into rounds.</li>
                <li>Drizzle just enough oil into a nonstick pan to coat the bottom of the pan, and place it on medium heat.</li>
                <li>When the oil begins to shimmer, but not smoke, add plantains (work in batches). Fry for 1 1/2 minutes on one side, flip and cook for 1 minute on the other side.</li>
                <li>Remove plantains from the pan and drain on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Continue frying in batches until all the plantains are fried.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle lightly with sea salt to give a sweet and salty taste to your fried ripe plantains.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy üòã</li>
            </ol>
