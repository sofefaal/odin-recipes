# odin-recipes
In this project, I will create a website consisting of a few recipes, using only HTML. 

Through this project, I'll use the different skill sets I learned on The Odin Project (TOP). I'll use HTML to create the webpages and add images and links (both absolute and relative links).

Based on this project, I have learnt how to incorporate links from the sample website, structure a webpage using HTML only, use ordered lists and unordered lists and finally add images to the web pages which has been saved on the computer drive. Through this project, it helped me understand the importance of adding accessibility features to my web pages to make the website more accessible for everyone.
